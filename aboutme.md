### Hello! I'm Breeanna Personett

I'm passionate about blending design and development to create intuitive digital experiences. My background in culinary arts taught me precision and creativity - skills I now apply to UX design and coding.

**What drives me:**
- Creating technology that's both beautiful and functional
- Solving real user problems through thoughtful design
- Continuous learning in both design and development

When I'm not designing, you'll find me gaming, fishing, or experimenting with new recipes!
