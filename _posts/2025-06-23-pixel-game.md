### Game Design Project  
**Games and Interactivity – 2D Pixel Shooter Game**  

In this course, I explored the full cycle of game creation from initial design to player feedback and iteration. Working in Unity, I developed a range of games that challenged me to experiment with mechanics, user engagement, and storytelling.

**Key Features:**  
- Start menu with New Game, Level Select, Instructions, and Exit options  
- Progressive difficulty across levels  
- Custom pixel art assets and animations  
- Original "Frog Fighter" concept with tongue-based combat  

**Development Process:**  
1. **Concept:** Created a Michigan-inspired pond defense game  
2. **Character Design:** Iterated through multiple frog sprites  
   - Initial full-body design → Simplified swimming animation  
   - Added explosive death sequence  
3. **Level Design:**  
   - Multiple water texture iterations  
   - Rocky borders for visual depth  
   - Progressive difficulty curve  

**Technical Highlights:**  
- Unity 2D physics implementation  
- Custom particle effects  
- Sound effect integration (including "licky" tongue attacks)
