### Event Design & Web Prototyping  
**SpartaHack 11 – MSU 24-Hour Hackathon**  

SpartaHack is Michigan State University’s annual 24-hour hackathon where hundreds of students collaborate to build apps, games, and innovative projects. As part of the **Operations Team**, I focused on **design and web prototyping** for this year’s event theme — **Pixel Art**.

**Key Features:**  
- Designed custom pixel art assets and icons to establish a cohesive event theme  
- Prototyped updated website layouts and visual elements in Figma  
- Supported branding consistency across web, social media, and print materials  
- Optimized UX structure and navigation for clarity and participant engagement  

**Development Process:**  
1. **Theme Concept:** Crafted a overgrown-tech inspired pixel art theme for the events identity  
2. **Pixel Asset Creation:**  
   - Designed event-specific icons, badges, and in-web visuals  
   - Iterated color palettes and visual motifs to unify branding  
3. **Web & UX Design:**  
   - Redesigned website structure to enhance participant navigation  
   - Applied responsive layout principles for mobile and desktop views  
   - Ensured visual hierarchy and accessibility best practices were followed  

**Collaboration & Skills Applied:**  
- Cross-functional teamwork with marketing and event teams  
- UI/UX prototyping and responsive web design in Figma  
- Pixel art creation using Procreate and Illustrator  
- Event design coordination and iterative feedback integration
