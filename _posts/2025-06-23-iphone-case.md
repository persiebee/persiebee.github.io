### iPhone Case Design Project  
**Introduction to Engineering Design â€“ Designing a Wallet Phone Case**  

This course provided my first structured experience with the engineering design process, blending technical skills with creative problem-solving. Through projects in Autodesk Fusion 360 (CAD modeling) and MIT App Inventor (mobile development), I learned to transform conceptual ideas into functional prototypes while considering real-world constraints.

#### The Design Process
**Concept:**  
- Wallet-integrated iPhone case with pop-socket stand functionality  
- Designed for convenience and security  
- Target audience: Professionals and students  

**Iterations:**  
1. Initial prototyping in Fusion 360  
2. User surveys (15/16 respondents indicated purchase interest)  
3. Material stress/strain testing  
4. Final ergonomic refinements  

#### Key Features  
- Secure card storage compartment  
- Multi-angle pop-socket stand  
- Slim profile (adds <5mm thickness)  
- Durable TPU material edges  

#### Project Deliverables
