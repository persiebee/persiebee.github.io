### ARTS MSU Website Redesign Project  
**Experience Architecture – Client-Centered UX Overhaul**  

This client project with ARTS MSU challenged our team to reimagine their digital presence through rigorous user research and iterative design. Partnering with Morgan Butts, we aimed to amplify awareness of campus arts programs while improving accessibility and navigation for students, faculty, and community members. Over eight weeks, we employed surveys, card sorting, and competitive analysis to transform a fragmented site into an intuitive hub for arts engagement.

#### The Design Process  
**Research & Discovery:**  
Our process began with a survey of 13 participants across MSU demographics. The data revealed critical gaps: 85% hadn’t heard of ARTS MSU, and the existing dropdown menus frustrated users with their click-heavy interaction. One respondent noted, *“The homepage doesn’t guide me—I’m not sure where to click first.”* We validated these findings through card sorting, grouping feedback into four pillars: *Layout* (visual hierarchy), *Accessibility* (ease of use), *Outreach* (social/media integration), and *Relevance* (student-focused content).  

**Strategic Iterations:**  
Inspired by institutions like the Art Institute of Chicago, we prioritized bold imagery and clear calls-to-action. I spearheaded the user flow redesign, condensing redundant sections (e.g., merging *Discover* into *Student Life*) and introducing hover-activated dropdowns—addressing 62% of survey complaints. Our team collaboratively prototyped in Figma, testing contrast ratios and mobile responsiveness to meet WCAG standards.  

#### Key Features  
- **Dynamic Homepage:** Rotating student artwork and event carousels to showcase campus creativity.  
- **Streamlined Navigation:** Hover-based menus with logical grouping (e.g., *Plan Your Visit* with venue filters).  
- **Integrated Outreach:** Social media feeds and newsletter signups positioned prominently.  

#### Project Deliverables
